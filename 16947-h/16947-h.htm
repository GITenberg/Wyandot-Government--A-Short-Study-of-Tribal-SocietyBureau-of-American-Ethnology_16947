<hr class="full" />
<p>In the social organization of the Wyandots four groups are
recognized&mdash;the family, the gens, the phratry, and the
tribe.</p>
<h2>THE FAMILY.</h2>
<p>The family, as the term is here used, is nearly synonymous with
the household. It is composed of the persons who occupy one lodge,
or, in their permanent wigwams, one section of a communal dwelling.
These permanent dwellings are constructed in an oblong form, of
poles interwoven with bark. The fire is placed in line along the
center, and is usually built for two families, one occupying the
place on each side of the fire.</p>
<p>The head of the family is a woman.</p>
<h2>THE GENS.</h2>
<p>The gens is an organized body of consanguineal kindred in the
female line. &ldquo;The woman carries the gens,&rdquo; is the
formulated statement by which a Wyandot expresses the idea that
descent is in the female line. Each gens has the name of some
animal, the ancient of such animal being its tutelar god. Up to the
time that the tribe left Ohio, eleven gentes were recognized, as
follows:</p>
<p>Deer, Bear, Highland Turtle (striped), Highland Turtle (black),
Mud Turtle, Smooth Large Turtle, Hawk, Beaver, Wolf, Sea Snake, and
Porcupine.</p>
<p>In speaking of an individual he is said to be a wolf, a bear, or
a deer, as the case may be, meaning thereby that he belongs to that
gens; but in speaking of the body of people comprising a gens, they
are said to be relatives of the wolf, the bear, or the deer, as the
case may be.</p>
<p>There is a body of names belonging to each gens, so that each
person&rsquo;s name indicates the gens to which he belongs. These
names are <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id=
"page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>derived from the characteristics,
habits, attitudes, or mythologic stories connected with, the
tutelar god.</p>
<p>The following schedule presents the name of a man and a woman in
each gens, as illustrating this statement:</p>

<h2>THE PHRATRY.</h2>
<p>There are four phratries in the tribe, the three gentes Bear,
Deer, and Striped Turtle constituting the first; the Highland
Turtle, Black Turtle, and Smooth Large Turtle the second; the Hawk,
Beaver, and Wolf the third, and the Sea Snake and Porcupine the
fourth.</p>
<p>This unit in their organization has a mythologic basis, and is
chiefly used for religious purposes, in the preparation of
medicines, and in festivals and games.</p>
<p>The eleven gentes, as four phratries, constitute the tribe.</p>
<p>Each gens is a body of consanguineal kindred in the female line,
and each gens is allied to other gentes by consanguineal kinship
through the male line, and by affinity through marriage.</p>
<p>To be a member of the tribe it is necessary to be a member of a
gens; to be a member of a gens it is necessary to belong to some
family; and to belong to a family a person must have been born in
the family so that his kinship is recognized, or he must be adopted
into a family and become a son, brother, or some definite relative;
and this artificial relationship gives him the same standing as
actual relationship in the family, in the gens, in the phratry, and
in the tribe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg
61]</span>Thus a tribe is a body of kindred.</p>
<p>Of the four groups thus described, the gens, the phratry, and
the tribe constitute the series of organic units; the family, or
household as here described, is not a unit of the gens or phratry,
as two gentes are represented in each&mdash;the father must belong
to one gens, and the mother and, her children to another.</p>
<h3>GOVERNMENT.</h3>
<p>Society is maintained by the establishment of government, for
rights must be recognized and duties performed.</p>
<p>In this tribe there is found a complete differentiation of the
military from the civil government.</p>
<h3>CIVIL GOVERNMENT.</h3>
<p>The civil government inheres in a system of councils and
chiefs.</p>
<p>In each gens there is a council, composed of four women, called
<i>Yu&#803;-wa&iacute;-yu-w&aacute;-na</i>. These four women
councillors select a chief of the gens from its male
members&mdash;that is, from their brothers and sons. This gentile
chief is the head of the gentile council.</p>
<p>The coucil of the tribe is composed of the aggregated gentile
councils. The tribal council, therefore, is composed one-fifth of
men and four-fifths of women.</p>
<p>The sachem of the tribe, or tribal chief, is chosen by the
chiefs of the gentes.</p>
<p>There is sometimes a grand council of the gens, composed of the
councillors of the gens proper and all the heads of households and
leading men&mdash;brothers and sons.</p>
<p>There is also sometimes a grand council of the tribe, composed
of the council of the tribe proper and the heads of households of
the tribe, and all the leading men of the tribe.</p>
<p>These grand councils are convened for special purposes.</p>
<h3>METHODS OF CHOOSING AND INSTALLING COUNCILLORS AND CHIEFS.</h3>
<p>The four women councillors of the gens are chosen by the heads
of households, themselves being women. There is no formal election,
but frequent discussion is had over the matter from time to time,
in which a sentiment grows up within the gens and throughout the
tribe that, in the event of the death of any councillor, a certain
person will take her place.</p>
<p>In this manner there is usually one, two, or more potential
councillors in each gens who are expected to attend all the
meetings of the council, though they take no part in the
deliberations and have no vote.</p>
<p>When a woman is installed as councillor a feast is prepared by
the gens to which she belongs, and to this feast all the members of
the tribe are invited. The woman is painted and dressed in her best
attire and the sachem of the tribe places upon her head the gentile
chaplet of feathers, and announces in a formal manner to the
assembled guests that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id=
"page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>the woman has been chosen a councillor.
The ceremony is followed by feasting and dancing, often continued
late into the night.</p>
<p>The gentile chief is chosen by the council women after
consultation with the other women and men of the gens. Often the
gentile chief is a potential chief through a period of probation.
During this time he attends the meetings of the council, but takes
no part in the deliberations, and has no vote.</p>
<p>At his installation, the council women invest him with an
elaborately ornamented tunic, place upon his head a chaplet of
feathers, and paint the gentile totem on his face. The sachem of
the tribe then announces to the people that the man has been made
chief of the gens, and admitted to the council. This is also
followed by a festival.</p>
<p>The sachem of the tribe is selected by the men belonging to the
council of the tribe. Formerly the sachemship inhered in the Bear
gens, but at present he is chosen from the Deer gens, from the
fact, as the Wyandots say, that death has carried away all the wise
men of the Bear gens.</p>
<p>The chief of the Wolf gens is the herald and the sheriff of the
tribe. He superintends the erection of the council-house and has
the care of it. He calls the council together in a formal manner
when directed by the sachem. He announces to the tribe all the
decisions of the council, and executes the directions of the
council and of the sachem.</p>
<p>Gentile councils are held frequently from day to day and from
week to week, and are called by the chief whenever deemed
necessary. When matters before the council are considered of great
importance, a grand council of the gens may be called.</p>
<p>The tribal council is held regularly on the night of the full
moon of each lunation and at such other times as the sachem may
determine; but extra councils are usually called by the sachem at
the request of a number of councilors.</p>
<p>Meetings of the gentile councils are very informal, but the
meetings of the tribal councils are conducted with due ceremony.
When all the persons are assembled, the chief of the Wolf gens
calls them to order, fills and lights a pipe, sends one puff of
smoke to the heavens and another to the earth. The pipe is then
handed to the sachem, who fills his mouth with smoke, and, turning
from left to right with the sun, slowly puffs it out over the heads
of the councilors, who are sitting in a circle. He then hands the
pipe to the man on his left, and it is smoked in turn by each
person until it has been passed around the circle. The sachem then
explains the object for which the council is called. Each person in
the way and manner he chooses tells what he thinks should be done
in the case. If a majority of the council is agreed as to action,
the sachem does not speak, but may simply announce the decision.
But in some cases there may be protracted debate, which is carried
on with great deliberation. In case of a tie, the sachem is
expected to speak.</p>
<p>It is considered dishonorable for any man to reverse his
decision after having spoken.</p>
<p>Such are the organic elements of the Wyandot government.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg
63]</span></p>
<h3>FUNCTIONS OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT.</h3>
<p>It is the function of government to preserve rights and enforce
the performance of duties. Rights and duties are co-relative.
Rights imply duties, and duties imply rights. The right inhering in
the party of the first part imposes a duty on the party of the
second part. The right and its co-relative duty are inseparable
parts of a relation that must be maintained by government; and the
relations which governments are established to maintain may be
treated under the general head of rights.</p>
<p>In Wyandot government these rights may be classed as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First&mdash;Rights of marriage.</li>
<li>Second&mdash;Rights to names.</li>
<li>Third&mdash;Rights to personal adornments.</li>
<li>Fourth&mdash;Rights of order in encampments and
migrations.</li>
<li>Fifth&mdash;Rights of property.</li>
<li>Sixth&mdash;Rights of person.</li>
<li>Seventh&mdash;Rights of community.</li>
<li>Eighth&mdash;Rights of religion.</li>
</ul>
<p>To maintain rights, rules of conduct are established, not by
formal enactment, but by regulated usage. Such custom-made laws may
be called regulations.</p>
<h3>MARRIAGE REGULATIONS.</h3>
<p>Marriage between members of the same gens is forbidden, but
consanguineal marriages between persons of different gentes are
permitted. For example, a man may not marry his mother&rsquo;s
sister&rsquo;s daughter, as she belongs to the same gens with
himself; but he can marry his father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s
daughter, because she belongs to a different gens.</p>
<p>Husbands retain all their rights and privileges in their own
gentes, though they live with the gentes of their wives. Children,
irrespective of sex, belong to the gens of the mother. Men and
women must marry within the tribe. A woman taken to wife from
without the tribe must first be adopted into some family of a gens
other than that to which the man belongs. That a woman may take for
a husband a man without the tribe he must also be adopted into the
family of some gens other than that of the woman. What has been
called by some ethnologists endogamy and exogamy are correlative
parts of one regulation, and the Wyandots, like all other tribes of
which we have any knowledge in North America, are both endogamous
and exogamous.</p>
<p>Polygamy is permitted, but the wives must belong to different
gentes. The first wife remains the head of the household. Polyandry
is prohibited.</p>
<p>A man seeking a wife consults her mother, sometimes direct, and
sometimes through his own mother. The mother of the girl advises
with the women councilors to obtain their consent, and the young
people <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg
64]</span>usually submit quietly to their decision. Sometimes the
women councilors consult with the men.</p>
<p>When a girl is betrothed, the man makes such presents to the
mother as he can. It is customary to consummate the marriage before
the end of the moon in which the betrothal is made. Bridegroom and
bride make promises of faithfulness to the parents and women
councilors of both parties. It is customary to give a marriage
feast, in which the gentes of both parties take part. For a short
time at least, bride and groom live with the bride&rsquo;s mother,
or rather in the original household of the bride.</p>
<p>The time when they will set up housekeeping for themselves is
usually arranged before marriage.</p>
<p>In the event of the death of the mother, the children belong to
her sister or to her nearest female kin, the matter being settled
by the council women of the gens. As the children belong to the
mother, on the death of the father the mother and children are
cared for by her nearest male relative until subsequent
marriage.</p>
<h3>NAME REGULATIONS.</h3>
<p>It has been previously explained that there is a body of names,
the exclusive property of each gens. Once a year, at the green-corn
festival, the council women of the gens select the names for the
children born during the previous year, and the chief of the gens
proclaims these names at the festival. No person may change his
name, but every person, man or woman, by honorable or dishonorable
conduct, or by remarkable circumstance, may win a second name
commemorative of deed or circumstance, which is a kind of
title.</p>
<h3>REGULATIONS OF PERSONAL ADORNMENT.</h3>
<p>Each clan has a distinctive method of painting the face, a
distinctive chaplet to be worn by the gentile chief and council
women when they are inaugurated, and subsequently at festival
occasions, and distinctive ornaments for all its members, to be
used at festivals and religious ceremonies.</p>
<h3>REGULATIONS OF ORDER IN ENCAMPMENT AND MIGRATIONS.</h3>
<p>The camp of the tribe is in an open circle or horse-shoe, and
the gentes camp in following order, beginning on the left and going
around to the right:</p>
<p>Deer, Bear, Highland Turtle (striped), Highland Turtle (black),
Mud Turtle, Smooth Large Turtle, Hawk, Beaver, Wolf, Sea Snake,
Porcupine.</p>
<p>The order in which the households camp in the gentile group is
regulated by the gentile councilors and adjusted from time to time
in such a manner that the oldest family is placed on the left, and
the youngest on the right. In migrations and expeditions the order
of travel follows the analogy of encampment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg
65]</span></p>
<h3>PROPERTY RIGHTS.</h3>
<p>Within the area claimed by the tribe each gens occupies a
smaller tract for the purpose of cultivation. The right of the gens
to cultivate a particular tract is a matter settled in the council
of the tribe, and the gens may abandon one tract for another only
with the consent of the tribe. The women councillors partition the
gentile land among the householders, and the household tracts are
distinctly marked by them. The ground is re-partitioned once in two
years. The heads of households are responsible for the cultivation
of the tract, and should this duty be neglected the council of the
gens calls the responsible parties to account.</p>
<p>Cultivation is communal; that is, all of the able-bodied women
of the gens take part in the cultivation of each household tract in
the following manner:</p>
<p>The head of the household sends her brother or son into the
forest or to the stream to bring in game or fish for a feast; then
the able-bodied women of the gens are invited to assist in the
cultivation of the land, and when this work is done a feast is
given.</p>
<p>The wigwam or lodge and all articles of the household belong to
the woman&mdash;the head of the household&mdash;and at her death
are inherited by her eldest daughter, or nearest of female kin. The
matter is settled by the council women. If the husband die his
property is inherited by his brother or his sister&rsquo;s son,
except such portion as may be buried with him. His property
consists of his clothing, hunting and fishing implements, and such
articles as are used personally by himself.</p>
<p>Usually a small canoe is the individual property of the man.
Large canoes are made by the male members of the gentes, and are
the property of the gentes.</p>
<h3>RIGHTS OF PERSON.</h3>
<p>Each individual has a right to freedom of person and security
from personal and bodily injury, unless adjudged guilty of crime by
proper authority.</p>
<h3>COMMUNITY RIGHTS.</h3>
<p>Each gens has the right to the services of all its women in the
cultivation of the soil. Each gens has the right to the service of
all its male members in avenging wrongs, and the tribe has the
right to the service of all its male members in time of war.</p>
<h3>RIGHTS OF RELIGION.</h3>
<p>Each phratry has the right to certain religious ceremonies and
the preparation of certain medicines.</p>
<p>Each gens has the exclusive right to worship its tutelar god,
and each individual has the exclusive right to the possession and
use of a particular amulet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg
66]</span></p>
<h3>CRIMES.</h3>
<p>The violations of right are crimes. Some of the crimes
recognized by the Wyandots are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adultery.</li>
<li>Theft.</li>
<li>Maiming.</li>
<li>Murder.</li>
<li>Treason.</li>
<li>Witchcraft.</li>
</ol>
<p>A maiden guilty of fornication may be punished by her mother or
female guardian, but if the crime is flagrant and repeated, so as
to become a matter of general gossip, and the mother fails to
correct it, the matter may be taken up by the council women of the
gens.</p>
<p>A woman guilty of adultery, for the first offense is punished by
having her hair cropped; for repeated offenses her left ear is cut
off.</p>
<h3>THEFT.</h3>
<p>The punishment for theft is twofold restitution. When the
prosecutor and prosecuted belong to the same gens, the trial is
before the council of the gens, and from it there is no appeal. If
the parties involved are of different gentes, the prosecutor,
through the head of his household, lays the matter before the
council of his own gens; by it the matter is laid before the
gentile council of the accused in a formal manner. Thereupon it
becomes the duty of the council of the accused to investigate the
facts for themselves, and to settle the matter with the council of
the plaintiff. Failure thus to do is followed by retaliation in the
seizing of any property of the gens which may be found.</p>
<h3>MAIMING.</h3>
<p>Maiming is compounded, and the method of procedure in
prosecution is essentially the same as for theft.</p>
<h3>MURDER.</h3>
<p>In the case of murder, if both parties are members of the same
gens, the matter is tried by the gentile council on complaint of
the head of the household, but there may be an appeal to the
council of the tribe. Where the parties belong to different gentes,
complaint is formally made by the injured party, through the chief
of his gens, in the following manner:</p>
<p>A wooden tablet is prepared, upon which is inscribed the totem
or heraldic emblem of the injured man&rsquo;s gens, and a
picture-writing setting forth the offense follows.</p>
<p>The gentile chief appears before the chief of the council of the
offender, and formally states the offense, explaining the
picture-writing, which is then delivered.</p>
<p>A council of the offender&rsquo;s gens is thereupon called and a
trial is held. It is the duty of this council to examine the
evidence for themselves and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>to come to a conclusion without
further presentation of the matter on the part of the person
aggrieved. Having decided the matter among themselves, they appear
before the chief of the council of the aggrieved party to offer
compensation.</p>
<p>If the gens of the offender fail to settle the matter with the
gens of the aggrieved party, it is the duty of his nearest relative
to avenge the wrong. Either party may appeal to the council of the
tribe. The appeal must be made in due form, by the presentation of
a tablet of accusation.</p>
<p>Inquiry into the effect of a failure to observe prescribed
formalities developed an interesting fact. In procedure against
crime, failure in formality is not considered a violation of the
rights of the accused, but proof of his innocence. It is considered
supernatural evidence that the charges are false. In trials for all
offenses forms of procedure are, therefore, likely to be earnestly
questioned.</p>
<h3>TREASON.</h3>
<p>Treason consists in revealing the secrets of the medicine
preparations or giving other information or assistance to enemies
of the tribe, and is punished by death. The trial is before the
council of the tribe.</p>
<h3>WITCHCRAFT.</h3>
<p>Witchcraft is punished by death, stabbing, tomahawking, or
burning. Charges of witchcraft are investigated by the grand
council of the tribe. When the accused is adjudged guilty, he may
appeal to supernatural judgment. The test is by fire. A circular
fire is built on the ground, through which the accused must run
from east and west and from north to south. If no injury is
received he is adjudged innocent; if he falls into the fire he is
adjudged guilty. Should a person accused of having the general
reputation of practicing witchcraft become deaf, blind, or have
sore eyes, earache, headache, or other diseases considered
loathsome, he is supposed to have failed in practicing his arts
upon others, and to have fallen a victim to them himself. Such
cases are most likely to be punished.</p>
<h3>OUTLAWRY.</h3>
<p>The institution of outlawry exists among the Wyandots in a
peculiar form. An outlaw is one who by his crimes has placed
himself without the protection of his clan. A man can be declared
an outlaw by his own clan, who thus publish to the tribe that they
will not defend him in case he is injured by another. But usually
outlawry is declared only after trial before the tribal
council.</p>
<p>The method of procedure is analogous to that in case of murder.
When the person has been adjudged guilty and sentence of outlawry
declared, it is the duty of the chief of the Wolf clan to make
known the decision of the council. This he does by appearing before
each clan in the order <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id=
"page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>of its encampment, and declaring in
terms the crime of the outlaw and the sentence of outlawry, which
may be either of two grades.</p>
<p>In the lowest grade it is declared that if the man shall
thereafter continue in the commission of similar crimes, it will be
lawful for any person to kill him; and if killed, rightfully or
wrongfully, his clan will not avenge his death.</p>
<p>Outlawry of the highest degree makes it the duty of any member
of the tribe who may meet with the offender to kill him.</p>
<h3>MILITARY GOVERNMENT.</h3>
<p>The management of military affairs inheres in the military
council and chief. The military council is composed of all the
able-bodied men of the tribe; the military chief is chosen by the
council from the Porcupine gens. Each gentile chief is responsible
for the military training of the youth under his authority. There
is usually one or more potential military chiefs, who are the close
companions and assistants of the chief in time of war, and in case
of the death of the chief, take his place in the order of
seniority.</p>
<p>Prisoners of war are adopted into the tribe or killed. To be
adopted into the tribe, it is necessary that the prisoner should be
adopted into some family. The warrior taking the prisoner has the
first right to adopt him, and his male or female relatives have the
right in the order of their kinship. If no one claims the prisoner
for this purpose, he is caused to run the gauntlet as a test of his
courage.</p>
<p>If at his trial he behaves manfully, claimants are not wanting,
but if he behaves disgracefully he is put to death.</p>
<h3>FELLOWHOOD.</h3>
<p>There is an interesting institution found among the Wyandots, as
among some other of our North American tribes, namely, that of
fellowhood. Two young men agree to be perpetual friends to each
other, or more than brothers. Each reveals to the other the secrets
of his life, and counsels with him on matters of importance, and
defends him from wrong and violence, and at his death is chief
mourner.</p>
<p class="spacedTB">The government of the Wyandots, with the social
organization upon which it is based, affords a typical example of
tribal government throughout North America. Within that area there
are several hundred distinct governments. In so great a number
there is great variety, and in this variety we find different
degrees of organization, the degrees of organization being
determined by the differentiation of the functions of the
government and the correlative specialization of organic
elements.</p>
<p>Much has yet to be done in the study of these governments before
safe generalizations may be made. But enough is known to warrant
the following statement:</p>
<p>Tribal government in North America is based on kinship in that
the fundamental units of social organization are bodies of
consanguineal <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id=
"page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>kindred either in the male or female
line; these units being what has been well denominated
&ldquo;gentes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These &ldquo;gentes&rdquo; are organized into tribes by ties of
relationship and affinity, and this organization is of such a
character that the man&rsquo;s position in the tribe is fixed by
his kinship. There is no place in a tribe for any person whose
kinship is not fixed, and only those persons can be adopted into
the tribe who are adopted into some family with artificial kinship
specified. The fabric of Indian society is a complex tissue of
kinship. The warp is made of streams of kinship blood, and the woof
of marriage ties.</p>
<p>With most tribes military and civil affairs are differentiated.
The functions of civil government are in general differentiated
only to this extent, that executive functions are performed by
chiefs and sachems, but these chiefs and sachems are also members
of the council. The council is legislature and court. Perhaps it
were better to say that the council is the court whose decisions
are law, and that the legislative body properly has not been
developed.</p>
<p>In general, crimes are well defined. Procedure is formal, and
forms are held as of such importance that error therein is <i>prima
facie</i> evidence that the subject-matter formulated was
false.</p>
<p>When one gens charges crime against a member of another, it can
of its own motion proceed only to retaliation. To prevent
retaliation, the gens of the offender must take the necessary steps
to disprove the crime, or to compound or punish it. The charge once
made is held as just and true until it has been disproved, and in
trial the cause of the defendant is first stated. The anger of the
prosecuting gens must be placated.</p>
<p>In the tribal governments there are many institutions, customs,
and traditions which give evidence of a former condition in which
society was based not upon kinship, but upon marriage.</p>
<p>From a survey of the facts it seems highly probably that kinship
society, as it exists among the tribes of North America, has
developed from connubial society, which is discovered elsewhere on
the globe. In fact, there are a few tribes that seem scarcely to
have passed that indefinite boundary between the two social states.
Philologic research leads to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Nowhere in North America have a people been discovered who have
passed beyond tribal society to national society based on property,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, that form of society which is characteristic of
civilization. Some peoples may not have reached kinship society;
none have passed it.</p>
<p>Nations with civilized institutions, art with palaces,
monotheism as the worship of the Great Spirit, all vanish from the
priscan condition of North America in the light of anthropologic
research. Tribes with the social institutions of kinship, art with
its highest architectural development exhibited in the structure of
communal dwellings, and polytheism in the worship of mythic animals
and nature-gods remain.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card

works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
